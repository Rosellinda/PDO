PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP.
1. Multiple Databases.
2. Security / Prepared Statements
3. Reusability

PHP prepared statements.
They are templates for sending queries or uploading data to SQL databases.

Using PDO or MySQLi, prepared statements provide an additional layer of security as the values are being sent
to the server separately from the query.
